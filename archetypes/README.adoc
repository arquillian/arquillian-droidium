== Arquillian Droidium Archetypes

Archetypes provide fast and easy way how to bootstrap your mobile testing project. You are welcome 
to generate your own project based on archetypes provided here. There are two projects present:

* native archetype
* web archetype

You can generate native project from native archetype, meaning you want to test pure native Android application. 
On the other hand, when you generate your project from web archetype, there will be prepared project for testing 
web application (war) which is meant to be deployed to JBoss AS container and it will be functionally tested 
from Android point of view.

=== Project generation

Project generation is very simple, after the installation of whole Droidium (`mvn install`), create some 
directory, enter there and execute:

-------------------------------------
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.arquillian.droidium.archetype \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=arquillian-droidium-archetype-native-test \
    -DarchetypeVersion=${droidium.version}
-------------------------------------

Interactive request-response dialog then follows, enter what is good for you:

-------------------------------------
Define value for property 'groupId': : net.joe.doe
Define value for property 'artifactId': : my-first-mobile-test
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : <enter>
Define value for property 'package':  net.joe.doe: : <enter>
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: net.joe.doe
artifactId: my-first-mobile-test
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
package: net.joe.doe
 Y: : <enter>
-------------------------------------

and you are done.

The similar process holds for the web project. There is already bundled Selendroid server (or Android server from Selenium respectively) 
for you so you just need to deliver your own applications under test on the class path and modify `@Deployment` method in test class accordingly.

Happy testing!
