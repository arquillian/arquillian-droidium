== Arquillian Droidium Web Implementation

In order to test this plugin, test expects that AVD is started and no Android server APK is installed on it.
You can specify name and console port of already started emulator by system properties placed on the command 
line while testing with Maven like this:

`mvn clean package -Ptest -Demulator.name=nameOfAVD -Demulator.port=5554 -Dandroid.server.path=path_to_server`

The default value of `emulator.avd.name` is `test01`. The default value of `emulator.avd.port` is `5554`.
The default value of `android.server.path` is `android-server-2.6.0.apk`. Please use Android 2.3.3 emulator 
since APK of version 2.6.0 is going to be installed.
