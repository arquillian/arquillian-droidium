== Arquillian Droidium - multiple Android devices test

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

This test shows how to use multiple Android containers in one test case. Activities are managed directly by AndroidDevice abstraction since there is not the native plugin on class path.

`mvn clean test -Dandroid.avd.name_1=name_of_avd_1 -Dandroid.avd.name_2=name_of_avd_2`

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
