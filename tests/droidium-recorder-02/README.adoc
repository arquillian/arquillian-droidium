== Arquillian Droidium recorder test

This demo project shows how to record videos of your devices while you are doing tests by Arquillian Droidium Recorder extension.

In order to try this test, you have you use physical device because at the 
time of the writing of this, there is not support of video recording of emulators.

Additionally, you have to use Android device of version 4.4+.

You can possibly span multiple test methods when you record videos, meaning starting in one method and stopping it in another.
