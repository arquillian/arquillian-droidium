== Arquillian Droidium recorder test

This demo projects shows how to record videos of your devices while you are doing tests.

It uses https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-recorder[Arquillian Reporter extension].

Videos can be taken automatically depending on how you setup 
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-droidium/tree/master/resources/droidium-recorder[Arquillian Droidium screenshooter].

Videos can be taken also manually as this test manifests. Videos are taken via 
injected `Recorder` into test method (test class). `Recorder` is container 
scoped so when injected, it will be covered by the instance of `AndroidDevice`. 

You make videos like follows:

----
@ArqullianResource Recorder recorder;

recorder.startRecording();
----

You stop video from recording by

----
recorder.stopRecording();
----

You can possibly span multiple test methods when you record videos, meaning starting in one method and stopping it in another.

You should stick to automatic video recording according to properties of +recorder+ extension set in +arquillian.xml+. That 
way of taking videos is more preferred.

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dandroid.avd.name=name_of_avd`

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
