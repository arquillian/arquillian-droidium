== Arquillian Droidium test - multiple deployments

Shows how to deploy more than one deployment into Android device.

Application which will be instrumented by Selendroid server has its `@Deployment` 
method annotated with `@Instrumentable`. If there is specified only one `@Deployment` method, 
you can ommit `@Instrumentable` annotation. This deployment will be instrumented automatically, 
preserving the previous behaviour. When more than one deployment is specified, you *have to* 
annotate the application you want to instrument by`@Instrumentable`.

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name_of_avd`

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
