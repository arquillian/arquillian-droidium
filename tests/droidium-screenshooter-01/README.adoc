== Arquillian Droidium screenshooter test - WebDriver

This demo projects shows how to take screenshots of your devices while you are doing tests.

Screenshots are taken via injected `Screenshooter` into test method (test class). 
`Screenshooter` is container scoped so when injected, it will be covered by the instance 
of `AndroidDevice`. You take screenshots like

----
@ArqullianResource Screenshooter screenshooter;

screenshooter.takeScreenshot();
----

Screenshot is saved by default to `target/` directory. You can set where to save 
all subsequently taken screenshots by calling, for example

----
screenshooter.setScreenshotTargetDir("target/some_dir");
----

You can take screenshots of different formats. Default format is PNG. You can take 
PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP and WBMP. The format of the screenshot is specified when you take 
screenshot like

----
screenshooter.takeScreenshot(ScreenshotType.GIF)
----

File name of screenshot is by default a random string. You can name it like 

----
screenshooter.takeScreenshot("myScreenshot", ScreenshotType.GIF);
screenshooter.takeScreenshot("myScreenshot2"); // taken as PNG
----

You can set the format of screenshots you want to take explicitly. From that point, 
all screenshots will be of that format when not specified otherwise.

----
screenshooter.setScreensthotImageFormat(ScreenshotType.BMP);
// all screenshots will be by default BMP images from now on
----

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dandroid.avd.name=name_of_avd`

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
