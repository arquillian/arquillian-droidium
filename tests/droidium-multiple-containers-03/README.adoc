== Arquillian Droidium multiple containers test

Tests scenario when you have JBoss container on class path and Android container on classpath 
and both are specified in arquillian.xml and there is Drone on classpath as well with 
webdriver extensions in arquillian.xml but no extension is asking for "android" browser 
so it is not necessary to start Android container at all.

This example is related to issue https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ARQ-1577[ARQ-1577]

To execute the test:

`mvn clean test`

JBoss AS container is automatically downloaded for you into `target` so you do not have to 
manage your JBoss instance on your own. Please be sure there is not any JBoss AS container already 
running before execution of tests.

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.
