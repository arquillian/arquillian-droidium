== Arquillian Droidium multiple containers test

Tests basic scenario when you have Android device and JBoss AS container adapters on classpath.

You have to specify these configuration parameters once you test, the tests will fail otherwise.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name-of-avd`

* `name.avd` - name of AVD you want to use while testing

JBoss AS container is automatically downloaded for you into `target` so you do not have to 
manage your JBoss instance on your own. Please be sure there is not any JBoss AS container already 
running before execution of tests.

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.
