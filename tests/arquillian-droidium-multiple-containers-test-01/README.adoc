= Arquillian Droidium multiple containers test

Tests basic scenario when you have Android device and JBoss AS container adapters on classpath.

You have to specify these configuration parameters once you test, the tests will fail otherwise.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name-of-avd -Dhome.jboss=home-of-jboss`

* name.avd - name of AVD you want to use while testing
* home.jboss - installation directory of your JBoss AS 7.1.1.
