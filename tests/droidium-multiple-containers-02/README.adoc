== Arquillian Droidium multiple containers test

Tests basic scenario when you have JBoss AS container adapter on class path but Android container 
adapter is not present on classpath but you have its container definition in arquillian.xml.

This example is related to issue https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ARQ-1509[ARQ-1509]

To execute the test:

`mvn clean test`

JBoss AS container is automatically downloaded for you into `target` so you do not have to 
manage your JBoss instance on your own. Please be sure there is not any JBoss AS container already 
running before execution of tests.

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.
