== Arquillian Droidium native test - multiple containers

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

Since there are two emulators running, you can choose different version of AVD for each test run. Specifying two 
AVDs of same name does not make sense since we usually want to know how tests are going for different AVD / platform.

We are simulating the execution of one test for multiple devices. This project is shown only for 
completeness and as a proof it is possible. You would normally use just one emulator and you would simply 
execute tests from Maven point of view twice - each time defining different AVD. 

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd.1=name_of_avd1 -Dname.avd.2=name_of_avd2`

Example:

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd.1=android-4.1.2 -Dname.avd.2=android-4.2`

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have jarsigner, keytool and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.
