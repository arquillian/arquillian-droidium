== Tests for Arquillian Droidium

This project shows various use cases of Arquillian Droidium container 
possibly cooperating with native and web extensions.

All necessary configuration needed in order to execute tests can be 
found in every project README separately.

*Selendroid server and Selendroid testing application APKs are located in this 
directory. Please copy them over to the root directory of each project when applicable 
(where pom.xml is located) in order to satisfy project dependencies.*

It contains these modules as standalone projects:

=== droidium-multiple-containers-01

This project tests a scenario when multiple container adapters are on the classpath,
which is not normally possible. It starts Android emulator of given AVD 
(or it is connected to it when such emulator is already running) and 
it starts / connects to JBoss AS 7.1.1 as well. This project does not 
use any additional plugins at all. It is not required to start your own 
JBoss AS instance since this is done automatically upon test execution. JBoss AS 
instance is extracted into your `target` and Arquillian is automatically connected to it.

=== droidium-multiple-deployments-01

This project shows how to deploy more than one `@Deployment` into your mobile device. Only 
one deployment will be instrumented by Selendroid server, another one (or more of them) will 
be just installed. This possibility provides you a way how to test scenarios when you need to 
deploy some other resources in order to perform the test itself (backed by Selendroid, Drone and 
WebDriver). Deployment which is meant to be instrumented is obliged to be annotated by `@Instrumentable`.

=== droidium-native-01

Tests test application from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project. 
Internally, it repackages Selendroid server according to application under test dynamically, 
then it installs it with test application. The instrumentation of application under test is 
executed (instrumentation is done by repackaged selendroid server) and testing is performed.

This project uses `arquillian-droidium-native` extension which does just mentioned. It uses 
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Drone[Arquillian Drone Web Driver].

=== droidium-hybrid-01

This project illustrates the usecase  when one wants to test
not only native application itself but web application embedded in native application as well.
Selendroid provides a way how to switch between so called _views_. We can look at 
an application from native point of view or we can test web application by web view 
which is embedded into native application.

=== droidium-web-01

Tests helloworld-like application which is deployed into JBoss AS and tests 
are performed in connection with WebDriver and Arquillian Graphene. Tests are 
executed against Android device - browser on Android device is started and 
functional tests are executed there. It is not required to start your own 
JBoss AS instance since this is done automatically upon test execution. 
JBoss AS instance is extracted into your `target` and Arquillian connects 
to this instance.

=== droidium-native-01-scala

Shows Arquillian Droidium integration with Scala.

=== droidium-screenshooter-01

Screenshooter project shows how to take screenshots with Droidium while you are doing your 
testing logic. Being able to take screenshots can be handy. You have plenty of options where 
and how to take screenshots, check that project and read documentation to know more! Happy 
screenshooting!
