== Tests for Arquillian Droidium

This project shows various use cases of Arquillian Droidium container 
possibly cooperating with native and web extensions.

All necessary configuration which is needed in order to execute every test project alone can be 
found in their respective README files.

In order to test all test projects in this directory in one batch in an automated manner, 
execute Gradle build script like this:

----
$ ./gradlew test
----

If you want to execute only one test, do it like this:

----
$ ./gradlew test -PsingleTest=<test project dir>
----

You can run test suite against different version of Selendroid server. Server is being built
dynamically (cloned from GitHub and built directly in Gradle script before tests' executions).

In order to run tests agains different Selendroid, use these properties, where _selendroidVersion_
is a version of Selendroid of that commit, e.g. "0.13.0-SNAPSHOT".

----
$ ./gradlew test -PselendroidCommit=<sha of commit> -PselendroidVersion=<version>
----

There is no need to download Android SDK and start emulators because test script does this all for you automatically. 

Test script uses https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-spacelift-gradle-plugin[Arquillian Spacelift Gradle Plugin].

It contains these modules as standalone projects:

=== droidium-multiple-androids-01

This test shows how to use multiple Android containers in one test case. Activities are 
managed directly by AndroidDevice abstraction since there is not the native plugin on class path.
You can use any number of Android devices in tests (in connection with ordinary Java EE containers)
so you can test very complex scenarios involving multiple Android devices in test run.

=== droidium-multiple-androids-02

Same as droidium-multiple-androids-01 but activities are managed by Drone injections so you can 
functionally test your Android applications deployed even to multiple Android containers and 
testing their interaction with possibility to involve ordinary Java EE application containers.

=== droidium-multiple-androids-with-jboss-01

Same as tests above but it adds JBoss AS 7.1.1 into play. You have two Android containers with 
third container as JBoss AS in one test run. You can e.g. deploy some war or ear to JBoss AS, 
then you can install your Android APKs to Android containers and then these APKs can have JBoss AS 
deployment as a backend - all in one test run.

=== droidium-multiple-containers-01

This project tests a scenario when multiple container adapters are on the classpath,
which is not normally possible. It starts Android emulator of given AVD 
(or it is connected to it when such emulator is already running) and 
it starts / connects to JBoss AS 7.1.1 as well. This project does not 
use any additional plugins at all. It is not required to start your own 
JBoss AS instance since this is done automatically upon test execution. JBoss AS 
instance is extracted into your `target` and Arquillian is automatically connected to it.

=== droidium-multiple-containers-02

Shows multiple container extension in action. When you have multiple containers in arquillian.xml 
but some container adapter is missing on the classpath for that container definition, it will not be 
added into container registry so it will not be started. There is internal matcher between 
container definitions in arquillian.xml and adapter classes present on class path.

=== droidium-multiple-containers-03

This project tests scenario when you have JBoss container on class path and Android container on classpath
and both are specified in arquillian.xml and there is Drone on classpath as well with
webdriver extensions in arquillian.xml but no extension is asking for "android" browser
so it is not necessary to start Android container at all.

=== droidium-multiple-deployments-01

This project shows how to deploy more than one `@Deployment` into your mobile device. Only 
one deployment will be instrumented by Selendroid server, another one (or more of them) will 
be just installed. This possibility provides you a way how to test scenarios when you need to 
deploy some other resources in order to perform the test itself (backed by Selendroid, Drone and 
WebDriver). Deployment which is meant to be instrumented is obliged to be annotated by `@Instrumentable`.

=== droidium-native-01

Tests test application from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project. 
Internally, it repackages Selendroid server according to application under test dynamically, 
then it installs it with test application. The instrumentation of application under test is 
executed (instrumentation is done by repackaged selendroid server) and testing is performed.

This project uses `arquillian-droidium-native` extension which does just mentioned. It uses 
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Drone[Arquillian Drone Web Driver].

=== droidium-native-02

This project shows how to use Droidium container in the standalone mode - there is not 
any native or web plugin on the class path during the test run but we can start and stop 
activities anyway. It is because of default activity manager implementation which gets 
treated by default. You can also install and uninstall packages to Android device as 
you are used to.

=== droidium-hybrid-01

This project illustrates the usecase  when one wants to test
not only native application itself but web application embedded in native application as well.
Selendroid provides a way how to switch between so called _views_. We can look at 
an application from native point of view or we can test web application by web view 
which is embedded into native application.

=== droidium-native-01-scala

Shows Arquillian Droidium integration with Scala.

=== droidium-screenshooter-01

Screenshooter project shows how to take screenshots with Droidium while you are doing your 
testing logic. Being able to take screenshots can be handy. You have plenty of options where 
and how to take screenshots, check that project and read documentation to know more! Happy 
screenshooting!
