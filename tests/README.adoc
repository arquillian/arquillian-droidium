== Tests for Arquillian Droidium

This project shows various use cases of Arquillian Droidium container 
possibly cooperating with native and web extensions.

All necessary configuration needed in order to execute tests can be 
found in every project README separately.

It contains these modules as standalone projects:

=== arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers-test-01

This project tests a scenario when multiple container adapters are on the classpath,
which is not normally possible. It starts Android emulator of given AVD 
(or it is connected to it when such emulator is already running) and 
it starts / connects to JBoss AS 7.1.1 as well. This project does not 
use any additional plugins at all. It is not required to start your own 
JBoss AS instance since this is done automatically upon test execution. JBoss AS 
instance is extracted into your `target` and Arquillian is automatically connected to it.

=== arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers-test-02

This project tests a scenario when you are using two Android containers - each of different versions 
and you are executing the same test cases. It is shown as for a completeness and as a proof it is possible.
You would normally use simple test with one AVD as with -native-test-01 but you woud execute it twice - each 
time with different AVD specified.

=== arquillian-droidium-native-test-01

Tests test application from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project. 
Internally, it repackages selendroid server according to application under test dynamically, 
then it installs it with test application. The instrumentation of application under test is 
executed (instrumentation is done by repackaged selendroid server) and testing is performed.

This project uses `arquillian-droidium-native` extension which does just mentioned. It uses 
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Drone[Arquillian Drone Web Driver].

=== arquillian-droidium-native-test-02

It is for the first time there is the usage of `SelendroidDriver` from Selendroid 
project shown. It uses Selendroid driver extension for Arquillian Drone - bringing Selendroid 
and Arquillian Drone very closely together.

=== arquillian-droidium-hybrid-test-01

This project illustrates the usage of `SelendroidDriver` when one wants to test
no only native application itself but web application embedded in native application as well.
Selendroid provides a way how to switch between so called _views_. We can look at 
an application from native point of view or we can test web application by web view 
which is embedded into native application.

=== arquillian-droidium-web-test-01

Tests helloworld-like application which is deployed into JBoss AS and tests 
are performed in connection with WebDriver and Arquillian Graphene. Tests are 
executed against Android device - browser on Android device is started and 
functional tests are executed there. It is not required to start your own 
JBoss AS instance since this is done automatically upon test execution. 
JBoss AS instance is extracted into your `target` and Arquillian connects 
to this instance.
