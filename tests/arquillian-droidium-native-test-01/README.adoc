== Arquillian Droidium native test

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name_of_avd`

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have jarsigner, keytool and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
