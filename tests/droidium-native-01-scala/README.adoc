== Arquillian Droidium native test in Scala - WebDriver

This project is based on Scala Maven plugin and it is coded in Scala language.
It is just rewritten `native-test-01` for Scala. No additional test coverage or 
functionality is provided and it is here just as a starting point to unfold your 
Scala testing experience with Arquillian, ShrinkWrap, Drone and Droidium.

You can use WebDriver, Arquillian Drone, Droidium, ShrinkWrap ... altogether in Scala!

In order to set up your IDE to be able to handle Scala based projects, please follow 
instructions http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html[here].

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dandroid.avd.name=name_of_avd`

This project can be run in a headless mode as well, typically in a CI service like Cloudbees.
You are obliged to activate headless profile with `-Pheadless`. It adds the following switches to `emulator` command 
upon its start: `-no-skin -no-audio -no-window -nocache -no-snapshot-save -no-snapstorage`.

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
