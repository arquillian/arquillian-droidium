= Arquillian Droidium

The aim of this document is to describe how to use Android container for Arquillian platform - Droidium. The reader can expect 
various use cases of arquillian.xml configuration as well as all needed artifact dependecies for Maven in order to 
be able to start some Android container successfuly.

== Concepts

The significant difference between ordinary container adapter for Arquillian and Android container is that while
using the ordinary one, you have to use only that one type of the container you are deploying the archives to. 
There is not the support for multiple container implementations in 1.0.x version of Arquillian out of the box 
so you are normaly forced not to mix two different container adapter implementations together. This restriction is 
overriden by module _arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers_ via which it is possible to use ordinary 
container adapter e.g. JBoss AS with Android container adapter itself. Because of this, you can then deploy 
your web application int JBoss AS container and you test it on you mobile phone (emulator or physical device).

The container is event driven. When some event is fired, all registered observers which listens to such kind of event 
executes appropriate method. This model is tree-like. The control is not returned to the initial point of fire until all 
subsequent logic is executed as well. Events can be chained, meaning when one event is fired and some method listens to it 
(via `@Observes` annotation), that method can fire another event to which some other method of some observer is listening 
as well.

Observers are registered in `DroidiumContainerExtension` in `arquillian-droidium-container-impl` module.

While inspecting the code, it is handy to have https://raw.github.com/smiklosovic/arquillian-thesis/master/resources/container-startup-droidium.png[container startup] and 
https://raw.github.com/smiklosovic/arquillian-thesis/master/resources/container-shutdown-droidium.png[container shutdown] charts in mind.

== Setup

When you want to try Droidium, you have to basically put into `pom.xml` just this dependency:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.arquillian.container</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-droidium-container-depchain</artifactId>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>${droidium.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Arquillian Droidium container uses _arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers_ module in this repository. That module, while on the 
classpath, is able to register containers of various types, so you can mix two (three, four ...) different 
container implementations. This module has to know what container implementation stands for what container adapter 
so in order to make the difference there is property `adapterImplClass` in the container configuration, the examples 
will be given. Adapter implementation class for Droidium container is `org.arquillian.droidium.container.AndroidDeployableContainer`.
Regretfully, at time of writing this document, you have to find out the implementation class of other container manually.

----
<group qualifier="containers" default="true">
    <container qualifier="jbossas">
        <configuration>
            <property name="adapterImplClass">
                org.jboss.as.arquillian.container.managed.ManagedDeployableContainer
            </property>
        </configuration>
    </container>
    <container qualifier="android">
        <configuration>
            <property name="adapterImplClass">
                org.arquillian.droidium.container.AndroidDeployableContainer
            </property>
        </configuration>
    </container>
</group>
----

You have to provide `adapterImplClass` property per container configuration only when you are using more then one 
container adapter implementation on your classpath - as in given example above. When you are using Android container 
alone, you do not have to specify that property since it is the only class on the classpath which implements Arquillian container API.

Put it all together, you can use just Android container itself as:

----
<container qualifier="android">
    <configuration>
        <properties ...
    </configuration>
</container>
----

When you want to operate upon more then one container, just register them like this:

----
<group qualifier="containers" default="true">
    <!-- Android container named "android1" -->
    <container qualifier="android1">
        <configuration>
            <properties ...
        </configuration>
    </container>
    <!-- Android container named "android2" -->
    <container qualifier="android2">
        <configuration>
            <properties ...
        </configuration>
    </container>
</group>
----

== Basic usage

You have to pay attention while injecting instances of Android container into the tests. 
`AndroidDevice` is `ContainerScoped`. Classes which are registered in `ContainerScoped` are 
available in tests only when:

* the test is running on the client side
* and
* is running in the context of a deployment that targets the container
** or
* you use `@OperatesOnDeployment` as a qualifier on the `ArquillianResource` injection point

`@Deployment` has to be specified.

Valid examples are following:

----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class ContainerTest {

    @ArquillianResource
    AndroidDevice android;

    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static Archive<?> createArchive() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(GenericArchive.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void test01() {
        assertTrue(android != null);
    }
}
----

You can use `@OperateOnDeployment` as well:

----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class ContainerTest {

    @ArquillianResource
    AndroidDevice android;

    @Deployment(name = "android1", testable = false)
    public static Archive<?> createArchive() {
       return ShrinkWrap.create(GenericArchive.class);
    }

    @Test
    @OperateOnDeployment("android1")
    public void test01() {
        assertTrue(android != null);
    }
}
----

When you want to use multiple `AndroidDevice`s you have to specify agains which deployment and containers 
these tests are supposed to be executed:

----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class ContainerTest {

    @ArquillianResource
    AndroidDevice android;

    @Deployment(name = "android1", testable = false)
    @TargetsContainer("android1")
    public static Archive<?> createArchive() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(GenericArchive.class);
    }

    @Deployment(name = "android2", testable = false)
    @TargetsContainer("android2")
    public static Archive<?> createArchive2() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(GenericArchive.class);
    }

    @Test
    @OperateOnDeployment("android1")
    public void test01() {
        assertTrue(android != null);
    }

    @Test
    @OperateOnDeployment("android2")
    public void test02() {
        assertTrue(android != null);
    }
}
----

As you spotted, we used `@Deployment(testable = false)`. That means our 
tests run in so called _client mode_. We are looking on the test from  
outside of the container, we are not modyifying an archive in order to be 
able to communicate with test which runs in container. We are dealing 
with container deployoment as it appears to us. It does not repackage 
our `@Deployment` archive nor it forwards the test execution to a 
remote server (or our Android device).

The second run mode is called _in container_ mode. It means that we want to 
repackage our `@Deployment` in a such way that Arquillian classes and infrastructure is added 
so there is the possibility to communicate with the test and enrich the test class which 
runs remotely. This mode is used by Arquillian by default.

Since you can be very used to _in container_ concept of testing, e.g when you 
test your EJBs or CDI beans, there will never be a need to test _in container_ 
while using Android container. We will handle tests only in client mode - 
perfectly suitable for functional testing of web as well as native Android applications.

== Android container is testing agnostic

Up to this point, you saw how container itself is configured but there are not _true_ tests.
It is because Android container _is not_ intended to test your code at all. The reason why Android container 
adapter implementation exists is that it provides common framework how Android device is 
started and shutted down. It treats device management of your emulator or physical device 
and it treats creation of AVD from scratch as well as management of Android SD cards which are used in 
connection with Android emulator.

=== Web testing
When you want to test your application, it depends what kind of application you want to test. If it is 
just normal web application (bundled as war/ear and deployed into application container as JBoss AS), you 
need to use plugin into Android container called *droidium-web* in this repository. Please consult README
there in order to know more. By this plugin, you can functionaly test your web application via WebDriver 
API from Selenium.

The basic workflow is very easy. You configure two containers in `arquillian.xml`. The first one is 
normal application container as JBoss AS, the second one is Android container. After that, you specify 
`@Deployment` for application container. That application is deployed there and finally you use 
WebDriver from Arquillian Graphene in order to do functional tests on your application but that application 
is view not from your desktop browser but from browser in you Android device!

Please consult README in *droidium-web* directory in order to get more information how to bootstrap your 
functional testing on Android platform.

=== Native testing
On the other hand, you can test your native Android application by writing some functional tests for it.
You have to use *droidium-native* plugin in this repository. Details how to test functionally your native 
Android application will be given in the README located in that plugin.


== Android container configuration

After seeing how to put Android containers in `arquillian.xml`, the configuration of the Android container itself is 
following. The list of all properties and its meaning is following, accompanied with examples. The division 
between physical Android Device and emulator is done.

=== General properties

==== home
===== default: $ANDROID_HOME

`home` property holds the directory where your Android SDK is installed. It is not necessary to specify it 
since it is automatically read from the system environment property `$ANDROID_HOME` which can be easily exported 
as `export $ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/sdk` for the current shell or it can be put into `~/.bash_profile` to be 
persisted.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="home">/path/to/your/android/sdk</property>
</configuration>
----

==== javaHome
===== default: $JAVA_HOME

`javaHome` property sets the directory where your JDK installation is placed. It can be set similarly as `home` property via
shell infrastructure. After setting this, it uses commands as `jarsigner` or `keytool` from there.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="javaHome">/path/to/your/java</property>
</configuration>
----

==== forceNewBridge
===== default: true

`forceNewBridge` boolean property specifies if Android Debug Bridge (ADB) should be forced to be created even it 
already is. It can have only `true` or `false` value. When not used, it is set to true.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="forceNewBridge">false</property>
</configuration>
----

==== adapterImplClass
===== default: org.arquillian.droidium.container.AndroidDeployableContainer

Specifies what is the implementation class of Arquillian Droidium container. You *have to* use this property 
when you place more then one Arquillian container adapter on the class path at time. For example, when you are 
doing web testing, you are using e.g. JBoss container. You are obliged to specify this property for every container 
adapter in configuration section in arquillian.xml with implementation class of adapter.

Note that you do not have to specify this property when you are using only Droidium container itself.

----
<group qualifier="containers" default="true">
 <container qualifier="android" default="true">
  <configuration>
   <property name="adapterImplClass">
     org.arquillian.droidium.container.AndroidDeployableContainer
   </property>
  </configuration>
 </container>
 <container qualifier="jbossas">
  <configuration>
   <property name="adapterImplClass">
    org.jboss.as.arquillian.container.managed.ManagedDeployableContainer
   </property>
  </configuration>
 </container>
</group>
----

=== Real Android Device Configuration

==== serialId
===== default: not defined

`serialId` property holds the identification number of your physical mobile phone or device (e.g. table). 
That number can be find out by command `adb devices -l` after your Android device is connected via usb cable to your computer.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="serialId">42583930325742351234</property>
</configuration>
----

=== Virtual Android Device Configuration

==== avdName
===== default: not defined

`avdName` property is about telling Android container which Android Virtual Device it should use. When you are 
creating some AVD, you have to enter its name. This property is that name.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="avdName">my-avd</property>
</configuration>
----

==== abi
===== default: as `android` uses

Pretty straightforward. Which ABI your container should use.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="abi">armeabi-v7a</property>
</configuration>
----

==== emulatorBootupTimeoutInSeconds
===== default: 120 seconds

Specifies timeout after which container is considered to be unsuccessfuly started. When emulator is not 
started after this amount of time, the whole test fails. It can be used as a prevention to wait for the 
start of the container for ever in case somehow hangs or your computer is slow to start it faster. 
The value has to be positive non-zero integer.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="emulatorBootupTimeoutInSeconds">180</property>
</configuration>
----

==== emulatorShutdownTimeoutInSeconds
===== default: 60 seconds

Similar as `emulatorBootupTimeoutInSeconds` but regarding of the emulator shutdown process. The value 
has to be positive non-zero integer.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="emulatorShutdownTimeoutInSeconds">45</property>
</configuration>
---- 

==== emulatorOptions
===== default: empty string

All other configuration switches you want to use for your emulator instance upon its start but there is not the configuration 
property for it. It is the string which is appended to the `emulator` command. Strings with quotes shoud work as 
well but its number has to be even. (They have to logically enclose some string).

----
<configuration>
    <property name="emulatorOptions">-memory 256 -nocache</property>
</configuration>
----

==== consolePort
===== default: not specified, selected by `emulator` automatically

Specifies which console port an emulator should use. It has to be even number in range 5554 - 5584. When this 
property is used and `adbPort` property is not, `adb` automatically selects as `adbPort` number `consolePort + 1`. 

----
<configuration>
    <property name="consolePort">5558</property>
</configuration>
----

==== adbPort
===== default: console port + 1

Specifies which adb port should emulator connect to. It has to be odd number in range 5555 - 5585.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="consolePort">5559</property>
</configuration>
----

==== generatedAvdPath
===== default: `java.io.tmpdir` plus `avdName`

This property instructs Android container adapter that the newly generated AVD should be saved in this directory.
Directory has to exist and user has to have write and read permissions. Newly created AVD is placed under this 
directory. The directory files are saved in has the name of `avdName`. By default, all newly created AVDs are 
saved in `java.io.tmpdir` plus `avdName` as well.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="generatedAvdPath">/tmp/generated_avds/</property>
</configuration>
----

==== droneHostPort
===== default: 14444

This property is used to set a port number on the localhost from where the communication to Android device will be carried out.
It is used in connection with web testing mainly (for sending REST calls from Graphene to Android server APK installed on the 
device) but it can be used for any other purposes. It is used as a port number for por forwarding command from Android debug bridge
(`adb`) on the host side.

==== droneGuestPort
===== default: 8080

The same as `droneHostPort` in principle but it treats port on device side.

== SD Card configuration

It is possible to use SD card while creating / using some emulator instance. 
When we are using more then one emulator and SD card is used, these emulators are 
using the same SD card which results in a clash. Creation of a SD card is backed by 
command `mksdcard` which is bundled in Android SDK. All inputs are validated. Size
constrains are the same as for the `mksdcard` itself and are checked for its 
validity on the container side.

Options you can use in connection with SD card configuration are as follows:

==== sdSize
===== default: 128M

Specifies that SD card of size `sdSize` is going to be used. In order to create SD card of size 512MB you have to
put this in the configuration:

----
<configuration>
    <property name="sdSize">512M</property>
</configuration>
----

==== sdCard
===== default: `android` specifies

Specifies filename where `sdCard` is placed or where it should be created when it does not exist. The suffix 
of the sdCard *has* to end with `.img`.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="sdCard">/tmp/my_sdcard.img</property>
</configuration>
----

==== sdCardLabel
===== default: generated randomly

Specifies label to use for a SD card we want to be created automatically. It does not have to be used.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="sdCardLabel">my_sdcard_label</property>
</configuration>
----

==== generateSDCard
===== default: false

Tells Arquillian that we want to generate card we specified. When this flag is used, the card is deleted after 
tests are done.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="generateSDCard">true</property>
</configuration>
----

== Logcat logging configuration

Arquillian Container comes with logcat support, which by default logs everything from logcat, that's of type 
`warning` and above, into `System.out` with a prefix `LOGCAT:`.

==== logLevel
===== default: W

Sets the level filter. Android supports following levels:

* `V` for verbose messages
* `D` for debug messages
* `I` for info messages
* `W` for warning messages
* `E` for error messages

If you set level to `V`, everything will be logged, if `W` then only warnings and errors.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logLevel">D</property>
</configuration>
----

==== logType
===== default: output

Used to define what should be done with the logs read from logcat.

* `output` - print to System.out
* `logger` - log through Logger instance
* `file` - save into file
* `disable` - disable logcat support

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logType">file</property>
</configuration>
----

==== logFilePath
===== default: target/logcat.log

If `logType` is set to `file`, this is the path, where the output log file will be stored. Make sure this path 
is accessible and writable.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logFilePath">target/logs/lolcat.log</property>
</configuration>
----

==== logPackageWhitelist
===== default: not defined

You can set, what would you like to always log, no matter of what. The whitelist is applied to process name, 
which for applications is a package name. The value can be comma separated list of rules, in which you can use 
`*` that will behave as regex's non-greedy expression `.*?`.

NOTE: If you set `logPackageWhitelist` and not `logPackageBlacklist`, it's assumed that you want to only log 
what's specified by whitelist, so the `logPackageBlacklist` will be set to `*`.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logPackageWhitelist">io.selenium*,system_server,org.example.showtime</property>
</configuration>
----

==== logPackageBlacklist
===== default: not defined

What's not catched by whitelist is then passed to blacklist. It works exactly the opposite way, that means 
whatever matches is discarted. As mentioned in `logPackageWhitelist` description, when you set `logPackageWhitelist` 
but not `logPackageBlacklist`, it will automatically get set to `*`. If you don't want this behavior, 
just make sure you set `logPackageBlacklist` in your configuration to empty value. This way you declare that you 
really want the `logPackageBlacklist` to be empty.

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logPackageBlacklist">org.example.*,com.android.phone</property>
</configuration>
----

==== logSerialId
===== default: false

This flag is useful if you're about to test more than one device at a time. If you set this flag to `true`, 
the outcome varies by `logType`. For `output` and `logger`, it will add the serial id of device to the prefix 
`LOGCAT (serial-id):`. When the `file` logging is selected, the final log file name will contain the serial id 
before the extension (e.g. target/logcat.log will change to target/logcat.serial-id.log).

----
<configuration>
    <property name="logSerialId">true</property>
</configuration>
----

== Connection logic of Android container

When the container you want to use, of some particular `avdName`, is not started, it is automatically started 
for you. You can look on this feature as the _managed_ container adapted does. The emulator is started upon 
every Arquillian test and it is also automatically shutted down after your tests are finished. Just as any 
managed container adapter.

If your Android emulator is already started, just use its `avdName`. Android container adapter is
automatically connected to it. This container is not shutted down afterwards. You can look at this as the
_remote_ version of the ordinary container adapter.

In general, we could sum up the logic which is used while trying to connect to an emulator instance or to 
create the new one as follows.

* If `serialId` was specified, we try to connect to that running physical device.
* If `consolePort` was specified but `avdName` name was not, we try to connect to running emulator which listens to specified `consolePort`. If we fail to connect, exception is thrown.
* If `avdName` was specified but `consolePort` was not, we try to connect to the first running emulator of such `avdName`.
* If both `avdName` and `consolePort` were specified, we try to connect to this combination or to start such emulator.

If we fail to get the device in the all above steps:

* If `avdName` was not specified, random AVD indentifier is generated.
* If there is not such `avdName` in the system, (generated from the step 1) the AVD of name `avdName` is automatically created.
* Emulator of AVD (possibly just created from scratch) is started.

After the test run, when `avdName` was generated randomly, this AVD is going to be deleted automatically.

Identifies are simple UUID strings. SD card identifiers are UUID strings as well. UUID identifiers are generated 
only when there is a need for them. 

== SD card usage logic

Creation of SD card depends on the combination of a few facts. Let's check the logic:

* If generateSDCard property is specified
** If sdCard is not specified
*** Generate random sdCard identifier
*** Create the card and use it
** If sdCard is specified
*** If such sdCard already exists, use that card
*** Create such sdCard and use it
* If generateSDCard property is not specified
** If sdCard is not specified
*** use default system SD card from Android
** If sdCard is specified
*** If it exists, use it
*** If it does not exist, use default system one.
